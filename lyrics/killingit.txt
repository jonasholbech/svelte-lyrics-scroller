[00:23.19]We＇re emptying our supplies
[00:24.55]We＇re only thinking about the
[00:26.19]Size of the pile of shit to buy
[00:27.91]Over and over we take what we want
[00:29.24]To take even if the bond with nature will break
[00:31.44]And when I lay me down to sleep
[00:34.09]I wonder why I＇m feeling fucking incomplete
[00:35.86]I must try to be the guy that defeats all the lies
[00:39.94]Wiser than the ones that I despise
[00:41.71]So listen now
[00:42.70]We＇re living in this world and we＇re killing it
[00:49.08]It＇s so absurd, and for dollar bills
[00:51.45]We keep on drilling it, until we＇re mentally ill
[00:55.58]A big burial site, no light in this endless night
[01:09.40]Please let me rewrite the story to get it right
